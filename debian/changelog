rumur (2018.12.20-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: boolean constants are now usable in boolean expressions, rather
    than being considered ranges.

  * Bug fix: indexing a non-array expression is now reported as an
    error, rather than causing an assertion failure.

  * Bug fix: calling a function with incorrect arguments is now reported as an
    error, rather than causing an assertion failure or uncaught exception.

  * Bug fix: trying to access the field of a non-record expression is now
    reported as an error, rather than causing an assertion failure or uncaught
    exception.

  * Bug fix: The boolean literals "true" and "false" are now accepted in all
    possible casings.

  * The "isundefined" operator is now implemented.

  * Range-typed expressions can now be passed in to functions as non-var
    parameters of a differing range type, where previously this scenario would
    only accept rvalues or identical range types.

  * If the generated verifier is multithreaded, it now prints a thread
    identifier in each progress line.

  * Some spurious compiler warnings when building the generated verifier have
    been suppressed.
