Description: model checker for the Murphi language
 Rumur is a model checker for use in the formal verification of finite state
 machines specified in the Murphi modelling language. It is based on a previous
 tool, CMurphi, and attempts to provide an approximate drop-in replacement for
 CMurphi.
 .
 Rumur works by reading an input file describing a collection of state variables
 and transition rules, from which it generates a C program to verify safety and
 security properties of this state machine. The generated verifier works by
 exhaustively exploring the state space, checking for violation of invariants or
 deadlocks.
 .
 In comparison to CMurphi, Rumur generates a verifier that runs significantly
 faster and uses less memory on large input problems. Rumur comes with an
 optional wrapper script, rumur-run, that streamlines the process of generating
 a verifier, compiling it, and then running it. This wrapper requires Python.
