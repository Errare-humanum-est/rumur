/* This model tests that quantifiers that pass over zero (i.e. negative start
 * and positive end) function correctly. In
 * 99529844092fcbe1bbbfb3170c7b9a8364a6d055, a bug was observed that caused
 * loops generated from such quantifiers to iterate 0 times. This originated
 * from a change in 79579fd5ee7cc3c120439b5d3187a09ffd5dcd6e. This model checks
 * that such a problem has not been reintroduced.
