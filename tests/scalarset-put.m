-- Test that we can print a scalarset variable. The initial implementation of
-- scalarset remapping caused code to be emitted in an order that had put
-- statements calling a function that had not yet been defined. This caused a
-- compilation failure of the generated verifier. If this problem has been
-- re-introduced, the code generated from this model will fail to compile.

  x: boolean;

  -- print it while it is undefined

  -- assign it a value
