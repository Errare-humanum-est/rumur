User-facing changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bug fix: boolean constants are now usable in boolean expressions, rather than
  being considered ranges (commits 3f8e25eed1b2cd88b04aec973b84efea3737f16b,
  6ee751955a0781becae7dcc0e34a7477e668e462).
* Bug fix: indexing a non-array expression is now reported as an
  error, rather than causing an assertion failure (commits
  606657b7fc656fd4c304523b98c5e2828a896271,
  a31c9973f63a719b676be97e7a893dd21d451511,
  5222f6ddce51ea66ceda6ecb0e016a94308e835b).
* Bug fix: calling a function with incorrect arguments is now reported as an
  error, rather than causing an assertion failure or uncaught exception (commits
  705793e6b0f3646d30dcab247d27cdd3ac94430c,
  2427b74c4d6fb40115943dc01bbd66cc4ada7d17,
  fe9344f5b723608cd8916bd16c2688f9494ca92a).
* Bug fix: trying to access the field of a non-record expression is now reported
  as an error, rather than causing an assertion failure or uncaught exception
  (commits f72373b30e8031baa8c8e0e953c05e47874ae854,
  76d09b6bf77414b51af2bf1da0ecd099c25ad2e1,

  b917ece31a209ba9586c7c44577ba34b19a2c0a7).
* Bug fix: The boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` are now accepted in all
  possible casings (commits 121d724c00e2afc1d1fa6c525dad958646936fb1,
  68e9164ae8a5a17c6e6346266051b24780bbf203).
* The ``isundefined`` operator is now implemented (commits
  d12841246e207a5691159f8ed46faf08cb596dd5,
  8e3563a0309d57dc19dbd7f0d1c50a8f30878559).
* Range-typed expressions can now be passed in to functions as non-var
  parameters of a differing range type, where previously this scenario would
  only accept rvalues or identical range types (commits
  343e97eeeb8ccd4c59bf150c42c0b74f1b00ec6a,
  09cfec88a1e648eaa240404c2b215ed4cefec926,
  2324e3efc370a09a289a4998c677cf1bfb31a245,
  90a95c31d5c04a6083f753bc15f566658abcdf9d).
* If the generated verifier is multithreaded, it now prints a thread identifier
  in each progress line (commit b222b3bc5fad2ff6e8371d3b46ad28809daa2451).
* Some spurious compiler warnings when building the generated verifier have been
  suppressed (commits 8a05ab0d209c0b8cbfa7048d5775505c1f70f283,
  4f447fdcc44f694f8bc1d948bbc17d690ca3d59f,
  7885b611ef9d9e6d18629b1eb696def0183eed16).

Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The use of ``static_assert`` has been replaced with ``_Static_assert`` (commit
  ad26fe525f7ba99dfbf3d5c6bc248ef41602d9a5).
* ``Expr`` and ``Decl`` gained a new ``is_readonly`` method (commit
  47c27f217b035fa9881fe32576354c08669b0899) and the distinction between the
  concepts of "lvalue" and "writable" is now more accurate.
* The test suite has been backported so it also runs on Python 2 in addition to
  Python 3 (commit 7fe028271d376188d8b5d6353e0bca720d12e6b9).
